Problem Description
This is a two player game. There are even number of coins arranged in a row. There will be alternate turns. In each turn,
a player can either select the first coin in the row or the last coin in the row and keep it with him. The objective of the
problem is to determine the maximum possible amount of money a player can definitely win, if he move first.

Problem Solution
In this problem, we will try to collect maximum amount without underestimating the opponent. We can choose
either the first or the last coin in the row. We will pick the one which results in giving us lesser amound to ensure that we can definitely win this much of amount irrespective of opponentâ€™s moves.
